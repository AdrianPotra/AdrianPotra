Certified Oracle NetSuite ERP Developer | Golang developer
----------------------------------------------------------

I started learning coding at university, with several languages throughout the semesters, like C++, Java, PHP and although I haven't really mastered any of them, I was always interested in that area of IT. Back in 2018 I decided to learn JavaScript and in summer of the same year, I had the opportunity to join Oracle in their technical team, supporting their ERP system called NetSuite. There I have honed my JavaScript skills, together with their own APIs, called SuiteScript APIs and I've learned for the first time what Web Services are all about, so now I'm quite proeficient in SOAP and REST based Web Services as well. I became a certified NetSuite developer and the rest is history. Since 2023, I started getting interested in Google's Go language, so I've learned that and I've also obtained a Go specialization certificate from the University of California, Irvine, after completing their courses, assignments and quizzes via Coursera. I did it because there are no official certifications you can obtain for this and I also wanted to get the point of view from a very good and experienced lecturer and learn things I might have missed before about Go. In my spare time I try to come up with new projects in Go and learn new technologies.

* üåç¬† I'm based in Brno, Czech Republic
* ‚úâÔ∏è¬† You can contact me at [adrianpotra@icloud.com](mailto:adrianpotra@icloud.com)
* üß†¬† I'm learning for AWS certifications, DevOps tools. As for the programming languages roadmap for 2024, it will be Python, TypeScript, brush up on my C++ and Java knowledge and if there is time, maybe another one like Swift, Kotlin
* ü§ù¬† I'm open to collaborating on Go projects, NetSuite projects
* ‚ö°¬†Fun fact: My nickname (in german) at elementary school was ,,lachmaschine" , which means laughing machine, since I was laughing quite often with a colleague during some classes (not the best thing to do, I know)
